### Study of PI based stochastic optimal control and Implementation of MPPI for Aggressive Driving

This project was submitted as the course project for RBE502 - Robot Control  in Spring 2018 at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. 

Course page - [https://users.wpi.edu/~jfu2/rbe502/index.html](https://users.wpi.edu/~jfu2/rbe502/index.html)

The project is to conduct a study on Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) Control and implement the same for aggressive driving for a car-like robot. This is primarily based on work presented in 

- [Aggressive driving with model predictive path integral control](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7487277/)
- [Model Predictive Path Integral Control: From Theory to Parallel Computation](https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/1.G001921)
- [Information Theoretic Model Predictive Control: Theory and Applications to Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.02342)
