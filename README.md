### Study of Model-Based RL - Model Predictive Path Integral Control 

This project is a course project for Reinforcement Learning in Robotics - in WS 2018 at the Technical University of Munich. 

The project is to conduct a study on Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) Control and implement the same for aggressive driving for a car-like robot. This is primarily based on work presented in 

- [Aggressive driving with model predictive path integral control](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7487277/)
- [Model Predictive Path Integral Control: From Theory to Parallel Computation](https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/1.G001921)
- [Information Theoretic Model Predictive Control: Theory and Applications to Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.02342)

This project is built and expanded on https://github.com/vvrs/MPPIController.
