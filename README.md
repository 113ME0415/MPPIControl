### Study of a stochactic optimal control method - Model Predictive Path Integral Control 

This project is a course project for Reinforcement Learning in Robotics - in WS 2018 at the Technical University of Munich. 

The project is to conduct a study on Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) Control and test its performance on Cart Pole, Inverted Pendulum and Mass-Damper system.
